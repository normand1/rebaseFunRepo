Musk went on to argue that our lack of contact with alien lifeforms could be down to any number of reasons, none of which suggest that intelligent lifeforms have simply never existed within our Universe. Instead, Musk suggests that our isolation is evidence that we are, in fact, living in some form of simulation. But if that's too 'out there' for you, he's also got another theory, suggesting that we could be part of an experiment being run by an even more advanced alien race looking to observe evolutionary behaviors, much the way a human zoo keeper studies the learning abilities of a Gorilla, or as Musk more-depressingly puts it, as a lab scientist would observe mold in a petri dish.
